The most popular type of wearable in 2019 is the smartwatch \cite{best_watches}. 
Smartwatches are devices worn on one's wrist,
equipped with sensors, and in some cases wireless communication capability for syncing data to a smartphone.
Some common examples of smartwatches are the Apple Watch (Figure \ref{fig:sub1}), 
Fitbit Charge (Figure \ref{fig:sub2}), and the Garmin Forerunner (Figure \ref{fig:sub3}),
all shown below in Figure \ref{watches:pictures}.
These devices are priced quite differently, carry different levels of functionality, and are
targeted towards different segments of the population. Shown below in Table \ref{watch:price} are 
prices for the watches listed above \cite{apple_price} \cite{fitbit_price} \cite{garmin_price}.

Clearly, these watches come at different price points, target different segments of the market, and
of course come with different architectures for accomodating the necessary features in each model. This
section will cover each of the watches shown above in greater detail.

% ========= APPLE WATCH ===============
\subsection{Apple Watch Series 5}
The Apple Watch Series 5 is the newest iteration of smartwatch from Apple Inc., released in September
2019. Priced at \$529, clearly this is considered a higher-end smartwatch, fitting in with Apple's
other product lines (iPhone, iPad, and Mac). This watch has all-day battery life, a touch screen, 
voice call, GPS, compass, and music streaming capabilities, as well as the ability to run thousands of
apps from the Apple App Store, made specifically for the Apple Watch \cite{apple_specs}.
