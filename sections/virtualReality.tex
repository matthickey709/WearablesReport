\subsection{Background}
Virtual Reality (VR) technology is an area of wearables that have been on the rise
as computer hardware capabilities improve. The Virtual Reality Society defines VR as
a 3D environment generated by a computer that a person can interact with, and be
immersed in such a way that the person can manipulate and interact with the environment
much like they would in \textit{actual} reality \cite{vr_soc_defn}. High-quality
technology and intelligent architectures are required to realize VR due to
the compute-intensive task of processing many inputs and rendering a virtual
world/environment in real time, and depending on the level of detail (LoD), is
an intensive task on its own \cite{hickey_wt4_pres}. Therefore, it is necessary
to make intelligent architecture design decisions to ensure the VR wearable operates
as intended, and with the correct performance specifications.

The most common type of VR wearable is the VR headset, and example is shown below in
Figure \ref{vr:example}. As illustrated, the headset is worn on the head (making it
a wearable), and its screen takes up the user's entire field of view - thereby immersing
them in a virtual environment. Some headsets include audio capabilities and movement
sensors, but this will be discussed later in this section.

\subsection{Typical Use Cases}
Due to the immersive and potentially high-fidelity rendering that VR can accomplish,
there are several key applications where this technology can be applied. For example, 
VR has the potential for entertainment, business, and medical applications.

\subsubsection{Entertainment}
For entertainment applications, VR has the potential to revolutionize video games.
VR offers the ultimate level of immersion, and allows players to feel as if they
are a part of the world in which they are playing, as shown below in Figure \ref{vr:saber}.
Different VR technologies offer additional peripherals, which can include treadmill-like
surfaces to track players' movements in-game without a controller, and controllers
shaped like gloves that offer haptic feedback when players interact with objects in-game,
thereby taking away elements that limit the immersion of video games \cite{vr_peripherals}.

    \label{vr:saber}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Business}
For business applications, VR can be used for modelling buildings before they break
ground, but also for completing expensive and dangerous training exercises at a lower
cost, and with zero risk - like ExxonMobil has started doing recently.
Exxon's VR simulator is quite advanced, letting users manipulate the 
virtual world by tracking their head, arm, and leg movements to allow them to 
complete virtual practice work on a model of one of Exxon's real assets \cite{exxon_vr}.
An example of Exxon's setup is shown in Figure \ref{vr:exxon}.
This allows extensive training to be completed with zero consequence of failure and
without having the need to actually send trainees to the platform.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Medical}
For medical applications, VR can be used as both a training tool (shown in
Figure \ref{vr:med_train}), and can allow the opportunity for telepresence 
surgery, where a surgeon can operate on a patient through virtual reality 
from a remote site, while complex machines follow the surgeon's actions 
with acute precision \cite{vr_med_app}. This will allow for doctors to receive
life-like training without having patients going under the knife, and will allow
patients requiring surgery in remote locations to have specialized surgery without the
presence of a specialized surgeon.

\subsection{Analysis of Examples}
Two popular examples of virtual reality headsets are the Oculus Quest and the Oculus
Rift S, both shown below in Figure \ref{headsets:pictures}. Much like the two
smartwatches discussed earlier in this report, these two headsets have different
capabilities, which will be discussed later. The pries for these two headsets are listed
below in Table \ref{headset:price} \cite{quest_price} \cite{rift_price}.

    \label{headset:price} 
\end{table}

Even though these two headsets come at the same price, they are targeted at different
market segments, and their architecture reflects that.

\subsubsection{Oculus Quest}
The Oculus Quest headset is designed to be an "all-in-one" headset, meaning
that it is the only piece of hardware needed to experience VR.
This means that all processing and content storage is handled on the headset itself,
and not by a computer where the headset acts as a display. Games are
loaded onto the device via a mobile phone app, and the headset can be used
anywhere to experience VR gameplay \cite{quest_features}. This device is
meant for consumers who want to experience VR gaming, but do not already have an
expensive gaming computer, or do not want to make that large investment.

\paragraph{Hardware and Functionality}
The Oculus Quest runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 mobile system on chip (SoC) \cite{oculus_dev_page}.
This SoC is responsible for all processing and wireless connectivity on the headset. Some 
of the technical specifications of the Snapdragon 835 are shown
below in Table \ref{table:snapdragon}. In addition to the specifications listed in Table
\ref{table:snapdragon}, the Snapdragon 835 has hardware and sensors to support
cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Near Field Communication (NFC), and location services
\cite{snapdragon_835}. The Snapdragon 835 is designed to offer powerful graphics
processing power in a low-power and low-footprint design, making it an appropriate
choice for a standalone VR headset.

    \centering
    \caption{Snapdragon 835 Technical Specifications}
    \csvautotabular{data/quest_specs.csv} 
    \label{table:snapdragon} 
\end{table}

The sensors onboard the Quest allow for six degrees of freedom (6DOF) in both the headset
and its controllers. This means that accurate tracking is provided for all three dimensions,
and orientation along those axes \cite{sixdof_defn}. The 6DOF tracking allows the player's
inputs to be as accurate as possible in the virtual world. The model of the Quest 
listed above for \$549 CAD comes with 64GB of internal storage, and 4GB of memory
\cite{quest_timemag}. The Snapdragon 835 SoC and these memory specifications
are very similar to that of a mobile phone. In fact, the Google Pixel 2 smartphone
uses the Snapdragon 835 chip, and comes with the same storage and memory
specifications \cite{quest_polygon}.

\paragraph{Oculus Quest Summary}
Given the fact that the Oculus Quest is a standalone VR headset, and it contains
near identical specifications to a smartphone, it is an appropriate choice to
be an entry-level purchase for a consumer wanting to try VR, without the large
up-front cost of a high-performance computer being a barrier to entry.
