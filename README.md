# ENGI 6861 - Computer Architecture Project

## Background
In the Computer Architecture course in Memorial University of Newfoundland's computer engineering program,
students are required to write a report on a topic relevant to computer architecture. I chose to write about
the architecture of wearable technologies, namely smartwatches and virtual reality headsets.
